One key concept about GitHub is its role as a centralized platform for collaborative version control,
 built upon the distributed version control system Git. 
This means that while Git allows individual developers to track changes and manage code locally, 
GitHub provides a web-based service that hosts these Git repositories, 
making it significantly easier for multiple individuals to work on the same project simultaneously, 
share their code, and manage contributions.
